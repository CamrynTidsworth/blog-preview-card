## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used CSS custom properties for the first time and found that they help streamline my workflow and clarify my code significantly. I also got some more practice with adding hover states, which I enjoy. 

### Continued development

This project touched on several important skills including CSS flexbox, CSS custom properties, and adding interactive elements to CSS. In the future, I would like to apply these skills to more complex projects.
